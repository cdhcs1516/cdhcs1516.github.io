### Introduction to the problem
A positive integer is a superpalindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.
Given two positive integers L and R (represented as strings), return the number of superpalindromes in the inclusive range [L, R].

Examples: 
```
Input: L = "4", R = "1000"
Output: 4
Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.
```

Contraints:
- 1 <= len(L) <= 18
- 1 <= len(R) <= 18
- L and R are strings representing integers in the range [1, 10^18).
- int(L) <= int(R)
